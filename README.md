# Back To Back SWE

An initiative to empower the software engineer to excel in the interview.

Our Vision: https://backtobackswe.com/our-vision

<b>The Exhaustive Topics A Software Engineer Needs To Know To Pass A Big N Interview:</b>
- Fundamentals of Computer Systems (just a general knowing how computers store information etc.)
- Big O Time & Space Complexity Computation
- Arrays
- Primitives
- Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion / Backtracking
- Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashtables
- Linked Lists
- Sorting
- Searching
- Min/Max Heaps
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees, Binary Trees, & Binary Search Trees
- System and OO design Principles (sometimes)

And that is pretty much it. These are the topics you need to know well to pass.

The channel's goal is to contribute to the community of people bridging
these topics to help engineers excel in the interview.

It has nothing to do with me. I am just here to communicate the ideas.

I am only a humble teacher, I am not perfect.

If even one person gets an offer from my work my day is complete.

## Mistakes

Again, I'm not perfect. I watch finished videos 2 times over. I read and test all code samples. But I still make errors.

If you see a mistake anywhere just let me know by opening an issue.

## Outdated Code

Sometimes Leetcode function signatures change or the names on fields of objects change breaking the code. If you see this then just open an issue or PR if you want to fix it.

## Best Books For Prep

My Comments: Cracking The Coding Interview is a good start but pales in comparison to how much Elements
of Programming Interviews (EPI) will prepare you for the interview. Everything that I do has been inspired
by this book. To date, I have read it nearly 5 times and skimmed it 4 times.
